1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- You would want to do this when you have a collaborative project and other people aer working on it, or when you are working on different machines.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- You may be working on some file locally without having committed the changes. As such, if GitHub pulled automatically, it'd overwrite your work.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Branches are simply versions of code. Clones are copies of repositores that you've made to your local machine. Forks are essentially clones, but they're made on GitHub.
